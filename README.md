# GWE_Churn 

This was originally from an assignment from my Predictive Analytics course as part of my MBA.   
It was originally completed using SAS and Excel but I recently used it to learn and play around with Python.

The goal was to study why certain customers churned and to develop a model to predict the likelyhood of churning. 

The project is a work in progress.
